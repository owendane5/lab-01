        <h2>The Biography</h2>
        <p>
            In 2003 on the first day of summer a miracle happened and I was born in Sudbury, Ontario. immediately I
            wasted no time on
            beginning my journey.

            Starting right off at my education the highschool choices I had went as far as living in a small town
            outside of the city would get
            you. With that in mind I completed my high school diploma at Chelmsford Valley District
            Composite School (CVDCS).

            After highschool I decided to take a year off to simultaneously take time to think of what I was gonna
            pursue as well as work full time to save up some money. During this time I worked at a machine shop. At this shop I was
            gonna agree to an apprentenship as I was doing great work there but, ultimitly I decided to move in to the
            programming field.

            After I made this decision it wasn't long before I apllied to attend Georgian College for programmin
            and fulfill one of my many passions.
